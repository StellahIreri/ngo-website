            <h3>Faith Mwihaki</h3>
            <p class="position">Member, African Diaspora Youth</p>
            <p>I bring a strong background in management along with extensive training and certifications in the mental health field. My passion for working with youth began early, when I volunteered at my church as a Sunday school and youth teacher. That passion grew into a lifelong commitment, leading me to spend over 15 years as a mental health counselor in a psychiatric hospital, specifically supporting adolescents.
               Throughout my journey, I’ve become known for being a good listener, showing kindness, leading with humility, and offering genuine care. I believe in treating others with love and respect while maintaining healthy boundaries. These values guide me in creating safe, supportive spaces where young people feel heard, valued, and empowered to grow.</p>
